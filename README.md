# Breast Cancer Diagnosis App

The **Breast Cancer Diagnosis App** is a machine learning-powered tool designed to support medical professionals in diagnosing breast cancer. The app predicts whether a breast mass is benign or malignant based on a set of input measurements.

## Key Features

- **Prediction**: Provides a diagnosis of benign or malignant breast masses.
- **Probability Scores**: Displays the probability of the mass being benign or malignant.
- **Visual Representation**: Includes a radar chart for visualizing the input data.
- **Data Input**: Measurements can be manually input or, optionally, obtained directly from a cytology lab machine (note: machine connectivity is not part of the app itself).

Note that this dataset may not be reliable as this project was developed for educational purposes in the field of machine learning only and not for professional use.
